# sslchecker

SSLChecker is a simple Python script that notifies you if a ssl certificate is about to expire. 
In times of the incredible Letsencrypt, it is always good to get reminders, if one of your certificates expires. 

Set it up as a cronjob and it will notify you way ahead of the expiration date.
