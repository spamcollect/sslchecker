# sslchecker

SSLChecker is a simple Python script that notifies you if a ssl certificate is about to expire. 
In times of the incredible Letsencrypt, it is always good to get reminders, if one of your certificates expires. 
But also in bigger environments, sometimes people have trouble managing their SSL certificates. 

Set it up as a cronjob and it will notify you way ahead of the expiration date. 

Never forget renewing your certificates ever again. 

Disclaimer: This is a super simple script and some of the programming could be nicer. Participation is more then welcome.
